Blank Canvas Cape Hardware resources.

This project contains all the source required to build the Blank Canvas Cape
(BCC).. The BCC was designed entirely in gEDA/PCB and targets a 4-layer PCB
with 6mil/6mil design rules. Prototypes were fabbed on the OSHPark PCB service
and have been verified to work.
