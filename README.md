Blank Canvas Cape Hardware resources.

This project contains all the source required to build the Blank Canvas Cape
(BCC) from source. The BCC was designed entirely in gEDA/PCB and targets a
4-layer PCB with 6mil/6mil design rules. Prototypes were fabbed on the
OSHPark PCB service and have been verified to work.
